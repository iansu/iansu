# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ian, I live in Calgary, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ and I work as a Principal Software Engineer at [Neo Financial](https://www.neofinancial.com) where we're building digital banking products for Canadians.

Iâ€™m a member of the [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) team where I primarily contribute as part of the [Tooling Working Group](https://github.com/nodejs/tooling). I also work on a number of other open source projects, mostly in the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystems.

If you are interested in supporting any of my open source work I encourage you to sponsor me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/iansu).
