# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ian, I live in Calgary, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ and I work as a Principal Software Engineer at [Neo Financial](https://www.neofinancial.com) where we're building digital banking products for Canadians. If you're in Canada you can sign up [here](https://neo.cc/V2W5M3R8) and get $25.

Iâ€™m the maintainer of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and I contribute to [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) as part of the [Tooling Working Group](https://github.com/nodejs/tooling). I also work on a number of other open source projects, mostly in the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystems.

If you are interested in supporting any of my open source work I encourage you to sponsor me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/iansu).
